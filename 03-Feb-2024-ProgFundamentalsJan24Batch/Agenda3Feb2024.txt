not to be executed in the code
firstNumber is a variable
*/

	display "Enter the First Number"
	read firstNumber
	display "Enter the Second Number"
	read secondNumber
	if firstNumber > secondNumber then

4. Write an algorithm in pseudo-code that takes a number as 
input and displays whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

start
	display "Enter a Number"
	read aNumber
	if aNumber > 0 then
		display "The Number "+aNumber+" Is Positive " 
		OR
		display "The Number is Positive "+aNumber

		display "The Number"+aNumber+" is Negative" /* The Number -200 is Negative */
	else
		display "The Number "+aNumber+" is Zero"
stop
=============
5. Write an algorithm in pseudo-code that takes three numbers 
as input from the user and calculates their average value.

start
	display "Enter First Number"
	read firstNumber
	display "Enter Second Number"
	read secondNumber
	display "Enter Third Number"
	read thirdNumber
	averageValue = (firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber )/ 3
	display "The Average of your Numbers is "+averageValue

/* BODMAS 
bracket of division multi addn sub  */
start
	display "Enter Temperature in Celsius"
	read tempInCelsius
	tempInFahrenheit = (tempInCelsius * 9 / 5) + 32

	read principalAmt
	display "Enter The Rate Of Interest"
	read rateOfInterest
	display "Enter the Time in Years"

9 = (9*9)+(9*9*9)

start
	display "Enter a Number"
	read aNumber
	squareOfNumber = aNumber * aNumber
	cubeOfNumber = aNUmber * aNumber * aNumber
	sumOfSquareAndCube = squareOfNumber + cubeOfNumber
	display "The Sum of Square and Cubes of The Number "+aNumber+" is "+sumOfSquareAndCube 
stop

=============
9. Write an algorithm in pseudo-code that calculates the ticket price 
for a movie based on the age of the customer as per the following criteria â€“
Age				Price
Children (age <= 12)		$5
Adults (age > 12 and <= 65)	$10
Seniors (age > 65)		$7

/*
